# Todo List

Just a reminder(for me)...

- [] Make a proper dialog component
- [] Image preview new layout
- [] Fix the popover positioning
- [x] Update select board with the current board
- [] Organize code
- [] Better layout for list of boards
- [] Filter list of boards
- [] Add dropdown menu configuration to header
- [] New post/thread dialog form?
- [] Mobile responsive design?
- [] Move to TypeScript?
