# Svelchan

A re-imagination of the (in?)famous [imageboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard)
website called [4chan](https://4chan.org).

## Motivation

*OG 4chan* is quite old looking, despite being cozy, and lack some really nice fetuares
present on other mobile software like [KurobaEx](https://github.com/K1rakishou/Kuroba-Experimental).
So, why not make a new bloated version of it?
